<?php
/* The "local" transport is talks to XMLSERVICE by calling a command on the IBM i.
   Rather than connecting via a database connection, it will fork a QP0ZSPWP job (by default) under the current user profile.
   Prerequisite: Install the "itoolkit-utils" package from Yum on your IBM i server.

   Advantages: Simple to use; no database connection needed; no additional user/pw authentication.
   Disadvantages: Runs under web server user (QTMHHTTP by default), which you may or may not want; forks a new job; only works locally on the same IBM i as XMLSERVICE.

   Note: If you already have a database connection, it would be more efficient to pass that in than to use local.
